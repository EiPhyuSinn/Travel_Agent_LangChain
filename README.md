# Aviationstack Flight and Airport Agent

- A conversational AI agent built with LangChain, powered by LLaMA 3 (via Groq), that can search for **flight status** and **airport information** using the [Aviationstack API](https://aviationstack.com/documentation).
- Flask is used to serve the backend API, which can be connected to a frontend or other services for flight and airport queries.
